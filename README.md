## Welcome to My GitHub! âœ¨ðŸ‘‹
Hello there! My name is Parisa Heidari, and this is my personal GitHub account where I keep track of the projects, assignments, and code I've been working on.ðŸ¥°

As a student, a lot of my repositories will contain homework assignments and coursework related to my studies. However, I also enjoy exploring personal coding projects and experimenting with new technologies in my free time.

Please feel free to take a look around and let me know if you have any questions or feedback. I'm always happy to connect with fellow programmers and learners. :D

Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding!
